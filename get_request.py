##### Session
import requests
from getpass import getpass

# By using a context manager, you can ensure the resources used by
# the session will be released after use
with requests.Session() as session:

    # Instead of requests.get(), you'll use session.get()
    response = session.get('https://api.github.com/user')

# You can inspect the response just like you did before
print(response.headers)
print(response.json())

'''
Transport Adapters let you define a set of configurations per service you’re 
interacting with. For example, let’s say you want all requests to 
https://api.github.com to retry three times before finally raising 
a ConnectionError. You would build a Transport Adapter, set its
max_retries parameter, and mount it to an existing Session:
'''
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from requests.exceptions import ConnectionError

github_adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=3)

session = requests.Session()

# Use `github_adapter` for all requests to endpoints that start with this URL
session.mount('https://api.github.com', github_adapter)

try:
    session.get('https://api.github.com')
except ConnectionError as ce:
    print(ce)
